My Gamesystem contained with 3 games:

1: Blackjack
	The card game of single player versus to bot whoever got 21 points won or point more than the enermy ('A'card can be 11 or 1 points).
2: NoThanks
	My real life favorite game!
	should be 3-5 players
	Every card in your hand is the plus points, and all coin will used to be decrease the points.
	The Player with the lowest coins is the winner.

	Begin game:
		every body got 11 coin (hide to another).
		deck card contained 33 cards (number 3-35).
		shuffle and count out 9 cards and set them aside.
	Turn:
		untill the card is out.
		place a  pass token on the active card ( card on the stand ) and playe pass to your left. You may not pass if you have no pass
		tokens to place on the active card
		if you want that card, take both card and tokens on top. then draw the new active card.
	rule:
		to count the point, if you have [12,13,14] [15] and 10 coins. The total point is 12+15-10 = 17

	example output:

	<No Thank> Deck have more |||||
	<No Thank> Coin in the middle have 0
	<Turn> Player number1: PING
	<Turn> Card on the stand 19
	Do you want to pick up 19
	(Y)es or (N)o (C)oin : y
	coin add == 0
	PING : [6] [8] [10] [12,13] [19] [33] [35]
	BOOM : [5] [14] [27] [30]
	DEEDDEEE : [3] [7] [20,21] [26] [29] [31]
	Next card

3. RockPaperScissorAI
	The program contained with a artificail intelligent (probably it not game..)
	Have to have GM to player with player.
	you have to input as if you win,lose or draw and the AI, then it will decises what you have to choose in the next turns
	finally will return all results(win,lose and draw) and percentage of the game.
